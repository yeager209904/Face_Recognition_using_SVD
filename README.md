# Face Recognition Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Face recognition is an exciting and rapidly advancing field within computer vision, with diverse applications ranging from security systems to personal identification. This repository contains an implementation of face recognition using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a powerful mathematical technique. This README file provides an overview of the project, explaining the principles behind SVD-based face recognition, the steps involved, and its advantages over alternative approaches.

## Overview

Face recognition using SVD involves several key stages:

1. **Training Dataset Creation**: A training dataset is created, comprising facial images along with their corresponding identities. Preprocessing techniques such as normalization, alignment, and illumination correction may be applied to enhance image quality and consistency.

2. **Vector Representation**: Each face image is converted into a vector representation, typically by flattening the image matrix.

3. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: The training dataset is decomposed into three matrices: U, Σ, and V^T, using the SVD algorithm. 
   - The U matrix contains the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the face images, known as "eigenfaces."
   - The Σ matrix contains the singular values.
   - V^T represents the transposed matrix of the right singular vectors.

4. **Recognition Phase**: An unknown face is processed similarly. It is converted into a vector representation and projected onto the subspace spanned by the eigenfaces obtained from the training dataset. Projection coefficients are computed by taking the dot product between the unknown face vector and the eigenfaces.

5. **Classification**: A classification algorithm such as nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), or neural networks is used to identify the unknown face. Classification is performed by comparing the feature vector of the unknown face with the feature vectors of known faces in the training dataset. The identity of the unknown face is determined based on the closest match.

## Advantages of SVD-based Face Recognition

SVD-based face recognition offers several advantages:

1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: It represents faces using a reduced set of eigenfaces, reducing computational complexity and storage requirements.

2. **Robustness**: SVD captures the most discriminative information in the training dataset, making it robust to variations in facial expressions, lighting conditions, and pose.

3. **Efficiency**: SVD is a well-established mathematical technique with efficient algorithms, enabling fast and accurate recognition.
